# Fullstack Open - Part7: React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack
Part 7 of the Full Stack online course https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7

## Exercise 7.1: routed anecdotes, step1
**Task:**
Add React Router to the application so that by clicking links in the Menu component the view can be changed.

At the root of the application, meaning the path /, show the list of anecdotes.

The Footer component should always be visible at the bottom.

The creation of a new anecdote should happen e.g. in the path create.

**Solution:**
Implemented as instructed.

## Exercise 7.2: routed anecdotes, step2
**Task:**
Implement a view for showing a single anecdote.

Navigating to the page showing the single anecdote is done by clicking the name of that anecdote.

**Solution:**
Implemented as instructed together with the previous exercise.

## Exercise 7.3: routed anecdotes, step3
**Task:**
The default functionality of the creation form is quite confusing, because nothing seems to be happening after creating a new anecdote using the form.

Improve the functionality such that after creating a new anecdote the application transitions automatically to showing the view for all anecdotes and the user is shown a notification informing them of this successful creation for the next five seconds

**Solution:**
Implemented as instructed.
